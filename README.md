# CURIOUS QIRA PODCAST

I've created a reponsive podcast called Curious Qira Podcast. In this podcast you will find show, search for shows using the searchbar on the Dasboard page, favourite episodes and find them in your favorites page :) I've used Netlify to deploy my site. Hope you enjoy

# Setting Up My Environment:

Installed Node.js from nodejs.org.
Use npx create-react-app my-app to create a new React project (replaced “podcast-5” with my desired project name - this was my 5th attempt on the project).
Navigated to your project folder using cd my-app, which is called "client". Though the name of my podcast is 'CURIOUS QIRA PODCAST'.

Project Structure and Code Organization:
Organized my project by grouping related components, styles, and utilities.

Component-Based Architecture:
Created functional components to encapsulate UI logic.
Used props to pass data between components.
Used component composition for complex UIs.


Fetching Data with APIs:
Used React’s built-in hooks (like useEffect and useState) to fetch data from APIs.
Updated the UI dynamically based on fetched data.

Styling:
Used Styled Components for reusable styled elements. I am more comfortable with CSS than Tailwind, so I've used Styling Components instead.

Performance Optimization:
Ensured a smooth user experience.

Deployment choice:
Netlify - https://master--curious-qira-podcast.netlify.app/


# Struggles:

State Management with Redux:
As your app grows, manage state effectively using Redux.
Centralize your app’s state and handle complex interactions.

Local Storage:
Struggled to get the local storage to show whenever I went on the FavoitesPage, which made it difficult to work on that page, but managed to fix the issue, by fixing up the syntax in my FavoritePage.

Time Management:
I've worked on this project for 4 days only, it was quite challenging trying to implement all the user stories in such a short amount of time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
